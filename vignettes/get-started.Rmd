## Introduction

There are two core verbs to linne: select and change. First you select an element (e.g.: a button) then apply changes (e.g.: change the color).

At its core the package consists of a family of selectors and a reference class around which much revolves. This reference class is instantiate from the `Linne` object with the `new` method.

```r
linne <- Linne$new()
```

Almost every method results the linne object itself so it can be piped around.

## Select

A core concept is that of selecting elements (to subsequently change their style). This is done mainly via the `sel_*` family of functions.

```{r}
shiny::p("Hello Linne", id = "myId")
```

For instance, were one want to change the style of the element above, one could select it using its `id` with:

```{r}
sel_id("myId")
```

Note that this prints the console the actual CSS selector it generates. There are many such `sel_*` functions, one could also select all `p()` to change them all at once.

```{r}
sel_tag("p")
```

The selectors are not useful on their own, they are meant to be used together with the `change` method where they indicate the element(s) one wants to change.

## Change

With elements selected one can change their style attributes. There way too many such attributes to list, you will find a comprehensive list on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/).

```r
linne <- Linne$
  new()$
  change(
    sel_id("myId"),
    fontSize = 20,
    color = "blue"
  )
```

Two things to note on the above, linne automatically converts integers and numerics into pixels: the above changes the size of the font of the element with `id = "myId"` to 20 pixels. Second, linne accepts camelCase, where the original CSS attribute is `font-size` above we use `fontSize`. Note that you may pass the original CSS attributes in backticks.

## Define

You can also `define` variables to use them in subsequent `change` methods. Note that those variables are passed bare (unquoted) in the `change` method.

```r
linne <- Linne$
  new()$
  define(primary_color = "blue")$
  change(
    sel_id("myId"),
    fontSize = 20,
    FontStyle = primary_color
  )
```

This is useful to organise code and avoid having to repeatedly specify the same value, it also makes it much easier to change those values later: change it once only.

## Include

Thus far we have customised CSS but we are yet to include it into a shiny application.

```r
library(shiny)
library(linne)

linne <- Linne$
  new()$
  change(
    sel_tag("p"),
    fontSize = 30,
    fontStyle = "italic",
    color = "darkblue"
  )

ui <- fluidPage(
  linne$include(),
  p("Hello {linne}!")
)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Show CSS

In order to learn and understand more about CSS you use the `show_css` method to print the generated CSS to the console this passes invisibly so you can put it anywhere without breaking the pipe.

```{r}
Linne$
  new()$
  change(
    sel_tag("p"),
    fontSize = 30,
    fontStyle = "italic",
    color = "darkblue"
  )$
  show_css()$
  change(
    sel_id("myId"),
    background = "red"
  )$
  show_css()
```
